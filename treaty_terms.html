            <h2>What Did Treaty 1 Promise?</h2>
            <p>Treaty 1 was an agreement between the Canadian government and First Nations groups in 1871. It included promises to help First Nations build a new life, especially in farming. Here are some of the main things promised:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Land for Families</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each family of 5 was promised 160 acres of land.</li>
                <li>This land was for farming and building homes.</li>
                <li>But not everyone got what they were promised.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Yearly Payments</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each person was promised $5 every year.</li>
                <li>This payment is still made today.</li>
                <li>The amount has never changed since 1871.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Help with Farming</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The government promised to give tools, animals, and seeds.</li>
                <li>This was to help First Nations start farming.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Education Support</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The treaty said schools would be built for First Nations children.</li>
                <li>Education was promised to help kids learn and succeed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Makes Treaty 1 Special?</h2>
            <p>Treaty 1 was the first treaty in what is now Western Canada. It became a model for other treaties. It talked about land, farming, money, and support. The idea was to help First Nations start a new way of life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why It Still Matters</h2>
            <p>Many of the promises made in Treaty 1 are still important today. Some are still being kept, like the $5 payments and education help. But some promises were broken or not fully kept, which has caused problems. Today, some First Nations are working on building stronger communities, with things like urban reserves and jobs for the future.</p>
