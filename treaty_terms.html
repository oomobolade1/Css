            <h2>What Did Treaty 1 Promise?</h2>
            <p>Treaty 1 was a 1871 treaty between the Canadian government and the First Nations people. The treaty promised certain things to help First Nations create a new life, especially in agriculture. Some of the major things promised</p>
            
            <h3>1. Land for Families</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There was a designated peice of land to a family of 5 which was equal to 160 acres.</li>
                <li>The designated land was for living purposes and agriculture.</li>
                <li>But not everyone got what they had been promised.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Each person was promised $5 every year.</li>
                <li>This payment is still made today.</li>
                <li>The amount has never changed since 1871.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Help with Farming</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The government promised to give tools, animals, and seeds.</li>
                <li>This was meant to help First Nations start farming.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Education Support</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The treaty said schools would be built for First Nations children.</li>

            <h2>What Makes Treaty 1 Special?</h2>
            <p>Treaty 1 was the first treaty in what is now Western Canada. It became a model for other treaties. It talked about land, farming, money, and support. The idea was to help First Nations start a new way of life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why It Still Matters</h2>
            <p>Many of the promises made in Treaty 1 are still important today. Some are still being kept, like the $5 payments and education help. But some promises were broken or not fully kept, which has caused problems. Today, some First Nations are working on building stronger communities, with things like urban reserves and jobs for the future.</p>
